/plan I want to plan a screening project for candidates that wanna join our company. I want a platform that they can login to via email, provide their linkedin, github, scholar accounts (work related socials in general). then they will be able to get information about our company, submit a request for a position (read from available positions). then for every position there will be a screening procedure that will be with an ai agent that's collecting information about the candidate (using elevenlabs api ) 
Then after collecting the information about the candidate there would be a possible there would be a submission form basically type of thing the platform would would take that offline and gather that information and think about sending the user like a confirmation in 10 minutes later about whether he has been confirmed or not and can he move to the next screening phase the idea is that those question would be triggering a code that would go through the answers and based on it it would classify that person and being relevant or irrelevant to what we are looking for on a scale between zero and one and there would be a threshold that would filter the ones that are not relevant and they would be sent an email from the platform saying that they have been advanced to the next level or not that's basically it about the next topic.

So if they are confirmed and they can move forward to the first interview. The first interview would be on the platform as well. It would be conducted as a playground to build stuff. We're talking specifically now about engineers. So the first role that we would be looking at in terms of automating the screening processes is for the engineers that are going to join the company. What we want to do there is create a virtual environment where that person would be able to access some kind of platform that we're going to send to him that's going to run on different technicalities. We can deep dive into later. He would be able to do a 30-60 minute work on any idea that he wants to see how he thinks about stuff and how he manages projects and how good he can build things with AI.

So we are looking for people that are AI-native at first and would create this environment variable, this virtual environment where they could access all the different tools that are pre-built with Claude Code instance with different other stuff. They would be able to access it remotely so they'll see a screen share if you'd like of that environment together with a text editor. So what they'll be able to do is create a project and innovate on ideas that they have and see how well they work with AI. All the things that they will do on this environment variable would be probably just a through a remote desktop or secured connection between them and a specific server that's going to be operated by us on the back-end probably via Docker or what not. It would run with predefined environments that would think about basically not exposing any APIs or any sensitive information either about API settings for different platforms or about other users and what they have done with the platform. So it would be like a unique instance spawned once per user without having the ability to continue that session from that point. We need to think about the complexity of that thing. Then what else?
