I'm reading your plan that you have created plan_01 and I want to talk about that.
So about the restricted requirements:
- Definitely there's an authentication I want to use. I think we could leverage Supabase authentication there.
- Instead of just implementing ourselves, I want to use Supabase in general as our database.
- Profile management I'm with you. Company portal, yeah definitely application systems sounds reasonable.
- In the application, there would be some form filling that you need to fill for that application and questions that are relevant for it. You can later down maybe add it save continue from past application forms stuff like that.
- In the voice AI voice screening interview, there would be a different plan. I want us to do another different plan on it and how it would look.
- About phase II technical interview, so that would be definitely a Docker-based per-candidate sandbox.
- I want you to explain to me what are the different environments that you think about? And a different sub-agent that would look at this.
- About the remote access, so part of this development environment would be with remote access. I definitely want to have another agent that's gonna be the planning for that project beta assessment.
- I want another agent that would create me a plan on this detailing specifically what would be the difference technologies that could be actually over here in how we can leverage that to make sure that it's working and functioning right.
- Pre-configure to tooling, I think Claude Code vs Code terminal those are all great options. I want to have all of them and probably a little bit more.
- Security architecture, I think I'm with you 

OK so what do we have here? The database system sounds good. Can profile, company portal, maybe about the email service. I think that I need you to explore that a little bit more to elaborate on that down the line because we need to think about how we're going to do that and what are the processes that that will allow this emailing function? There could be probably like solutions already available. Try to look at the different skills to actually implement that.

About the phase II AI screening, there would be definitely some work there. Basically what I want to do is I wanna I want you to create let's look at this way. I want you to first create another agent for every single big topic that we have discussed above and as you think about all of them would do a plan mode of them created different would create a different plan with a name plan file in the context out file with a name of let's call it Plan_02 and then _ the subplans. Plan of that specific component and then we'll take it from there
